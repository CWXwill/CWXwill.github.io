				<h3 id='history'>Badminton origin and development</h3>
		</center>

				<h4 id='his'>Games employing shuttlecocks have been played for centuries across Eurasia, but the modern game of badminton developed in the mid-19th century among the expatriate officers of British India as a variant of the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. Its exact origin remains obscure. The name derives from the Duke of Beaufort's Badminton House in Gloucestershire,but why or when remains unclear. As early as 1860, a London toy dealer named Isaac Spratt, A New Game, but no copy is known to have survived. An 1863 article in The Cornhill Magazine describes badminton as "battledore and shuttlecock played with sides, across a string suspended some five feet from the ground". <br>

				The game originally developed in India among the British expatriates, where it was very popular by the 1870s. Ball badminton, a form of the game played with a wool ball instead of a shuttlecock, was being played in Thanjavur as early as the 1850s and was at first played interchangeably with badminton by the British, the woollen ball being preferred in windy or wet weather.</h4><hr>

		<div class='col'> <img src='https://www.loc.gov/loc/legacy/images/libguides/news/badminton.jpg' width='400px' height="400px"> <h5 class="coltype">A little-known fact is that badminton is the world’s fastest racket sport, with shuttlecocks traveling up to 200 miles per hour. Invented by British military officers in India in the mid-1800s, badminton soon spread to the rest of the world. Though badminton clubs sprouted up in the United States in the late 19th century, the sport never really took off on the competitive level, as it was overshadowed by the more popular racket sport, tennis.</h5></div>

Shortly after, Poona diffused into the motherland through Colonial English soldiers; it was renamed Badminton after the duke of Beaufort introduced the sport at his country estate, Badminton, from which the game derives its name. Years later, in 1887, the Bath Badminton Club was formed. In 1893, the Badminton Association of England was entirely replaced, which transcribed the rules of the game. As of today, these rules are still used to govern competitive Badminton.</h5></div>

The tournaments which were added was Uber Cup for women’s team, Sudirman Cup for mixed team, World Championship, World Juniors, World Grand Prix Finals and none other than the World Cup. International Management Group or IMG started the World Cup to be an invitational event from 1981. But for certain reasons, the IBF tried to stop the World Cup by replacing it with some world class exhibition of legendary players.</h5></div>
